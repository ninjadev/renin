Renin is a browser-based demo creation library and tool built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">Three.js</a> and <a href="https://vite.dev">Vite</a>.<br/>It is the successor to <a href="https://github.com/ninjadev/nin">nin</a>, Ninjadev's old demo tool.
</p>
  
<br/>

## Getting started

```shell
npx renin init mydemo
cd mydemo
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Now visit localhost:3000 to start renin. Try modifing the source in mydemo/src/ to get started. Happy hacking!

## Project status

Renin is quite new and pretty rough around the edges.
Currently, basic editing, live-reloading and jogging is implemented.
Compilation/export is sort of implemented, but could use some more polish.
As such, it should be able to make a demo with this already :tada:

Rendering to video has not been implemented yet.

## How is renin different compared to nin?

- The entire UI is WebGL (threejs).
- No graph.json -- instead, the graph is implicitly defined in the code directly in the node relationships.
- New experimental visualization of nodes as layers.
- Typescript and modern tooling/imports/etc which makes the coding experience much nicer.
- It uses vite "as a backend" instead of the node backend + html frontend architecture of nin.
